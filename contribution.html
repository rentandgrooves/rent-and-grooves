								<h2>Our Experiences</h2>
                                <p>We committed a whole lot more. We made much more effort to branch effectively and had fewer issues caused by merges. 
									We more clearly split work between members which resulted in less duplicate work initially. 
									However, we had more issues with organization and had to change the architecture to adapt to issues with integration. 
									Some of our issues did not become apparent early on which led to time crunches. We also had to rewrite some code in order to avoid SOLID violations 
									and inheritance issues, which ends up being the same as duplicate work in the long run. We have solved much of our technical debt from iteration 1, 
									but have replaced it with different technical debt instead. For iteration 3 we will have to focus on not creating new debt since there will not be 
									any chance to pay it off. We will also have to more carefully plan out our new pieces to avoid confusion or conflicting designs between layers.
