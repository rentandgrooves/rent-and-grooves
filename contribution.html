								<h2><u><b>Our Experiences</b></u></h2>
                                <p>We committed a whole lot more. We made much more effort to branch effectively and had fewer issues caused by merges. 
									We more clearly split work between members which resulted in less duplicate work initially. 
									However, we had more issues with organization and had to change the architecture to adapt to issues with integration. 
									Some of our issues did not become apparent early on which led to time crunches. We also had to rewrite some code in order to avoid SOLID violations 
									and inheritance issues, which ends up being the same as duplicate work in the long run. We have solved much of our technical debt from iteration 1, 
									but have replaced it with different technical debt instead. For iteration 3 we will have to focus on not creating new debt since there will not be 
									any chance to pay it off. We will also have to more carefully plan out our new pieces to avoid confusion or conflicting designs between layers.

								<h2><u><b>Individual Experiences</b></u></h2>
                                <h3><b>Scott Barett</b> </h3>
								<p><i>"There was many firsts in this project for me. This was the first time I had used an actual version control system that wasn’t just naming a file something like, “Main_V2_FinalV4”. This was the first time I have used any online repository for storing and tracking code. And this was the first time I have ever developed anything for android. It was plenty to learn all at once, but I feel these skills will be useful for the future."</i></p>
								<h3><b>Edwin Duong</b></h3>
								<p><i>"I found learning Git to be a necessity, which forced me to learn how to commit, push, pull, and merge in a way that contributed nicely to the project."</i></p>
                                <h3><b>Ethan Lapkin</b></h3>
								<p><i>"I found that I had to adjust to layering code pieces properly, I am not used to working on projects with such a high number of files that layering is necessary. I also had to learn how to manage working with code I had not wrote and being able to read code quickly and write code that can be read quickly."</i> </p>
                                <h3><b>Harkeerat Mayall</b></h3>
								<p><i>"There was a lot more I learnt than building a music player from scratch. I came to know what goes into development before development even starts, communicating ideas, proposing ideas, trying to implement them, discussing more ideas and finding out ways to clean up the technical debt. I also gained the perception of seeing a project as a whole and how layering the project properly affects the quality of code for example, adding a button to the UI would not only require just adding a button tag but also going through the logic and data layers making it more readable and the work division more clear."</i></p>
								<h3><b>Cuong Ta</b></h3>
								<p><i>"During the process, I learned how to make tests, also learned a new way to run all our tests using AllTests.java which is very useful (considering it has coverage option). In addition, while making the website for the project, I tried using Jekyll for the first time and I find it very interesting but since I did not have much time so I would stick to HTML&CSS. I'll try that again during the summer. I also learned a way to create a carousel to display information, which is really nice!"</i></p>
