								<h2><b><u>Our Vision</u></b></h2>
								<p>The Rent&#119070;Groove (R&#119070;G) system will serve as an easy to use platform for renting music, giving users the ability to effortlessly rent and enjoy a diverse catalog of songs. It facilitates only charging for the music people want to listen to, rather than paying for the whole catalog of songs. It will allow users to listen to the songs rented at any time while they still own it.</p>
								<p>The system is primarily designed for use by music enthusiasts seeking a simple way to access and listen to their favorite music. It will permit the users to search the whole catalog of songs, choose songs to rent and add them to their library, there would be an additional option to purchase a song permanently which would then be available in their library till their account exists. They can then play these songs at all times from their device. As part of our commitment to innovation, Rent&#119070;Groove also introduces advanced features such as curated playlists, personalized recommendations, and an overall easy-to-navigate interface to play and manage music.</p>
								<p>This system will be a significant improvement over the current systems in use, that offer the whole song catalog to the user for an expensive subscription fee. It would allow a more affordable, accessible, and user-friendly way to play, rent and groove to music without any hassle.</p>
								<p>Economically, Rent&#119070;Groove seeks to provide a cost-effective solution for music enthusiasts. The application aims to eliminate the need for expensive subscriptions and licensing fees, making high-quality music rental more accessible to a broader audience. The system will offer different tiers of subscription starting from the free option, it will allow users to get more perks with each subsequent tier. We anticipate that this approach will contribute to the economic well-being of our users while establishing Rent&#119070;Groove as a leading player in the music rental industry.</p>
								<p>The success of Rent&#119070;Groove will be measured by user satisfaction, determined through feedback and surveys. Additionally, increased user engagement will be a key metric of success. We aim to achieve 100k+ unique users and 1M+ rented songs in 2 years.</p>
